# simple ssh backdoor 

##execute
``````
python sshbackdoor.py
```
or

make it executable by adding ```#!/usr/bin/env python ``` to the top of the script or making the file executable with chmod +x sshbackdoor.py and then running:

``````
./sshbackdoor.py
```
##but its shit
yes I made this 2yrs ago and I had it on my old hard drive so I thought I'd just upload it here, I assumed someone could maybe make use of it and could even use it as a base to start a project. 

This can probably still be found on pastebin when I uploaded 2yrs ago but who cares.
